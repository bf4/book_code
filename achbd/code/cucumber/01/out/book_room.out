Feature: Traveler books room
  In order to reduce staff
  As a hotel owner
  I want travelers to book rooms on the web

You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given /^a hotel with "([^"]*)" rooms and "([^"]*)" bookings$/ do |arg1, arg2|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end
