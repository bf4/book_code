Usage: spec (FILE|DIRECTORY|GLOB)+ [options]

    -p, --pattern [PATTERN]          Limit files loaded to those matching this pattern. Defaults to '**/*_spec.rb'
                                     Separate multiple patterns with commas.
                                     Applies only to directories named on the command line (files
                                     named explicitly on the command line will be loaded regardless).
    -D, --diff [FORMAT]              Show diff of objects that are expected to be equal when they are not
                                     Builtin formats: unified|u|context|c
                                     You can also specify a custom differ class
                                     (in which case you should also specify --require)
    -c, --colour, --color            Show coloured (red/green) output
    -e, --example [NAME|FILE_NAME]   Execute example(s) with matching name(s). If the argument is
                                     the path to an existing file (typically generated by a previous
                                     run using --format failing_examples:file.txt), then the examples
                                     on each line of thatfile will be executed. If the file is empty,
                                     all examples will be run (as if --example was not specified).
                                      
                                     If the argument is not an existing file, then it is treated as
                                     an example name directly, causing RSpec to run just the example
                                     matching that name
    -s, --specification [NAME]       DEPRECATED - use -e instead
                                     (This will be removed when autotest works with -e)
    -l, --line LINE_NUMBER           Execute behaviour or specification at given line.
                                     (does not work for dynamically generated specs)
    -f, --format FORMAT[:WHERE]      Specifies what format to use for output. Specify WHERE to tell
                                     the formatter where to write the output. All built-in formats
                                     expect WHERE to be a file name, and will write to $stdout if it's
                                     not specified. The --format option may be specified several times
                                     if you want several outputs
                                      
                                     Builtin formats for code examples:
                                     progress|p               : Text-based progress bar
                                     profile|o                : Text-based progress bar with profiling of 10 slowest examples
                                     specdoc|s                : Code example doc strings
                                     nested|n                 : Code example doc strings with nested groups intented
                                     html|h                   : A nice HTML report
                                     failing_examples|e       : Write all failing examples - input for --example
                                     failing_example_groups|g : Write all failing example groups - input for --example
                                      
                                     Builtin formats for stories:
                                     plain|p                  : Plain Text
                                     html|h                   : A nice HTML report
                                     progress|r               : Text progress
                                      
                                     FORMAT can also be the name of a custom formatter class
                                     (in which case you should also specify --require to load it)
    -r, --require FILE               Require FILE before running specs
                                     Useful for loading custom formatters or other extensions.
                                     If this option is used it must come before the others
    -b, --backtrace                  Output full backtrace
    -L, --loadby STRATEGY            Specify the strategy by which spec files should be loaded.
                                     STRATEGY can currently only be 'mtime' (File modification time)
                                     By default, spec files are loaded in alphabetical order if --loadby
                                     is not specified.
    -R, --reverse                    Run examples in reverse order
    -t, --timeout FLOAT              Interrupt and fail each example that doesn't complete in the
                                     specified time
    -H, --heckle CODE                If all examples pass, this will mutate the classes and methods
                                     identified by CODE little by little and run all the examples again
                                     for each mutation. The intent is that for each mutation, at least
                                     one example *should* fail, and RSpec will tell you if this is not the
                                     case. CODE should be either Some::Module, Some::Class or
                                     Some::Fabulous#method}
    -d, --dry-run                    Invokes formatters without executing the examples.
    -O, --options PATH               Read options from a file
    -G, --generate-options PATH      Generate an options file for --options
    -U, --runner RUNNER              Use a custom Runner.
    -X, --drb                        Run examples via DRb. (For example against script/spec_server)
    -v, --version                    Show version
    -h, --help                       You're looking at it
