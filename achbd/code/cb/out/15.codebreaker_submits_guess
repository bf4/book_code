You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given /^the secret code is "([^"]*)"$/ do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end
When /^I guess "([^"]*)"$/ do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^the mark should be "([^"]*)"$/ do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end
